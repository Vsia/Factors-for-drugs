# Factors-for-pharmaceutical-drugs
The use of medication to diagnose, cure, treat or prevent diseases is something almost
certain that every person in their life will take part in, whether it be a prescription from a doctor
or over the counter. The pharmaceutical industry is one of the biggest industries in the world.
With the mass distribution of medicine this industry does daily, it is important that people choose
and take the correct form of medication. In this project, we will find which factors contribute
most to user satisfaction from drug performance. We chose The Drug Performance Evaluation
dataset to best help us complete our goal. With the results, we will be able to help the customers
understand which factors or information to look for that will result in higher customer
satisfaction when selecting medication. This can also highlight to the pharmaceutical businesses
which factors to include with their products when selling to consumers to achieve the highest
customer satisfaction possible
